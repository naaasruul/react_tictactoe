## What I Learned  

Building this Tic-Tac-Toe game in React was more than just a coding exerciseâ€”it was a deep dive into writing clean, maintainable, and scalable components. Throughout the project, I refined my understanding of:  

- **Component Structuring** â€“ Knowing when to split components to keep the code modular and reusable.  
- **Forwarding Props** â€“ Passing data effectively between components while maintaining clarity.  
- **Creating Flexible Components** â€“ Designing UI elements that adapt to different use cases.  
- **State Management** â€“ Handling component state efficiently and ensuring a smooth user experience.  
- **Deriving State from Props** â€“ Reducing redundancy by computing state based on props when needed.  
- **Lifting State Up** â€“ Managing shared state effectively between parent and child components.  

This project was a great way to sharpen my React skills while keeping things fun! ðŸš€
